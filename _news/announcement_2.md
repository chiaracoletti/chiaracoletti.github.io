I will be presenting our work "*Towards direct neuronal-current MRI: a novel statistical processing technique for measurements in the presence of system imperfections*" at ISMRM this year. Join the session [Modelling signals throughout the body](https://www.ismrm.org/21/program-files/D-114.htm){:target="\blank"} on Wednesday May 19th (17:00 CEST) to find out more!
