Chiara is a PhD student in [Imaging Physics](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/imphys/){:target="\_blank"} at the [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/){:target="\_blank"}. She received her double M.Sc. degree in Biomedical Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/){:target="\_blank"} and [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en){:target="\_blank"}. During her M.Sc., Chiara was among the 1% of students selected for the excellence program [Alta Scuola Politecnica](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en){:target="\_blank"}, she completed an exchange semester at the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en){:target="\_blank"} in Sweden and she worked as a research assistant at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/){:target="\_blank"}.
Currently, Chiara is a member of the Magnetic Resonance Systems Lab ([MarsLab](https://www.mars-lab.eu/){:target="\_blank"}) where she is working on advancing quantitative MRI under the supervision of Sebastian Weingärtner. Chiara’s research focuses on developing new direct and non-invasive contrast mechanisms for functional brain MRI, beyond conventional BOLD imaging. She is part of the organizing committee for [ISMRM Benelux](https://www.ismrm-benelux.org/){:target="\_blank"} meeting 2022. With her work, Chiara aims at integrating physics, engineering and computational sciences to unlock new frontiers in neuroscience through MRI.
